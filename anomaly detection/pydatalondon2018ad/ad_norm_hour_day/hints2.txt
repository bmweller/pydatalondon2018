Hint: You can use the np.maximum function(df['a'], df['b'])
      to take the higher of two
      columns in a DataFrame and the corresponding np.minimum
      function to take the lower of two columns.

Hint: You can use del df['a'] to delete a column named 'a' from a DataFrame

Hint: You can use np.maximum(df['a'], 0) to replace values
      in df['a'] with zero.
