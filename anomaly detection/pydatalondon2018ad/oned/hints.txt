Hint: You can assign the count the number of times the id occurs
      to a new column with the following:

      df['id_freq'] = df.groupby('id')['id'].transform('count')


Hint: You can use np.logical_and(a, b) to combine two boolean columns

Hint: Use the .isin() method on a string column to check if the string
      is one from a list given


Hint: You can filter a DataFrame with conditions
      by placing the condition in brackets, e.g. `df[df.a > 1]`
      or with `df.query('a > 1 or not (b < 2)')`.
